Create-React-App gives a nice bootstrapped project. I like being able to lint outside of the build or run process of the application, like on pre-commit hooks with husky. To do that I needed to add linting to my create-react-app. Follow these steps to add linting to your create-react-app project and get linting outside of your build process.

## Install packages 📦

This is the most painful part of the process I kept installing one package after another to see if linting worked. All-in-all eight packages later I finally had everything there and ready to run based on the configurations from create-react-app.

```bash
npm i --save-dev babel-eslint eslint-config-react-app eslint-plugin-flowtype eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

```bash
yarn add --dev babel-eslint eslint-config-react-app eslint-plugin-flowtype eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

## Add ESLint Configuration to `package.json`

You can either supply this in a separate file (`.eslintrc.json`/`.eslintrc.js`) or right in your `package.json`. For larger configuration changes I would recommend a separate file but I'm just extending the react-app configuration and applying a couple of rule adjustments.

```json
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "react-app",
    "rules": {
      "semi": 0,
      "no-console": 0
    }
  },
```

## Add Linting Script

Now, all we need to do is to add the linting script to our `package.json` and we'll be able to lint whenever we want. Even hook up husky or add a specific step for linting in our CI/CD pipeline.

```json
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "lint": "node_modules/.bin/eslint --ext js src"
  },
```
