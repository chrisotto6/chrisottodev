title: Gatsby - Add a Published Filter To Posts

I like [Dev.to](www.dev.to)'s published filter. It allows you to continue to write posts until they're ready to be
viewed by everyone. If you are not familiar with the feature; in the `frontmatter` of your post there is a `boolean` named
`published`. If it's set to false, the post is visible to you and people that have the link. Once it's set to true then
it is visible to the world!

I wanted to add that feature to my personal [Gatsby](www.gatsbyjs.com) site so that I can have articles in progress while
not finishing them if I need to commit other changes. The one difference with my implementation is that the post won't be
available to the client at all until it is published. The outline for the change:

- Update all existing posts have `published: true` in their `frontmatter`
- Add/Update filters to Graphql queries throughout my site keying in on the field set to `true`
  - gatsby-config.js
  - gatsby-node.js
  - Pages
  - Templates

## Applying the Updates 😎

### Add `published` to the frontmatter

```markdown
 tags: ['gatsby','react']
+ published: true
---
```

This change was made to all existing posts so that right away the Graphql queries I update down the line return data. Also
I created a dummy post that had the `published` boolean set to false to verify that it was excluded from the list of posts.

### Adding the filter to `gatsby-config.js` queries

Within my `gatsby-config.js` I have two queries. One query hooks up to the Algolia search for my site and the other populates
the RSS feed. For both queries, I do not want posts that are not published to show up.

#### Algolia query

```graphql
  allMdx(
    filter: {
      fields: { slug: { ne: null } },
      fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "/posts/"},
+     frontmatter: { published: { eq: true } }
    }
```

#### RSS Feed

```graphql
    frontmatter: {
      author: { ne: null },
+     published: { eq: true}
    }
```

### Apply filter to `gatsby-node.js`, components and templates

The `createPages` in `gatsby-node.js` function uses the query to find out which pages should be created in my case this applies to posts and pages.
Applying the filter to the components and pages makes sure that the unpublished posts don't creep in and cause errors because there
is no post page to route to.

#### gatsby-node

```graphql
    allMdx(
+     filter: { fields: { slug: { ne: null } }, frontmatter: { published: { eq: true } } }
      sort: { fields: [fields___prefix], order: DESC }
      limit: 1000
    )
```

#### Tag Page and Index Template

```graphql
    posts: allMdx(
      filter: {
        fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "//posts/[0-9]+.*--/" }
+       frontmatter: { published: { eq: true } }
      }
```

#### Tag Template

```graphql
  query PostsByTag($tag: String) {
    allMdx(
      limit: 1000
      sort: { fields: [fields___prefix], order: DESC }
+     filter: { frontmatter: { tags: { in: [$tag] }, published: { eq: true } } }
    )
```

### Testing and Wrap Up 🙌

At this point all the changes have been made to test out the change. All existing posts should be present and flow through
searching, post pages, tag pages and RSS feed, all except for the one dummy post. I did some smoke testing by navigating around
the components and pages updated to ensure that everything was working as expected and all existing automated tests passed. Win-win.
Now I can keep posts as a work in progress until they're ready to be published and still get other development work merged in.

Do you filter out in progress work from your Gatsby site? What approach did you take?
