I have a nice little [side project](https://library.chrisotto.dev/) based on the Goodreads API (yes, my key is still active). I had it up for a while and whenever I would refresh a page while it was deployed it would lose context to the page. This is because Netlify didn't know how to handle the state I had gotten myself into because the routing in `create-react-app` that I was using was `react-router`.

Luckily enough this is an easy fix, so if you also have the following:

- Create React App client side routing through `react-router`
- Deploy your site on Netlify

...then you will be able to make the same change and have your page context persist after refreshes!

## Creating a Redirects File 💻

In your `public` directory create a new `__redirects` file with the following code:

```txt
/*  /index.html  200
```

Now when the project gets built by Netlify, Create-React-App will place the contents of the `public` directory into the build output. Allowing Netlify to handle `pushState` from within your application. That's it!
